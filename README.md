# Machine translation
In this project, I build a machine translation model Using CNNS, GRUS, transformers that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline. My completed pipeline will accept English text as input and return the French translation.

## Setup

This project requires GPU acceleration to run efficiently.
