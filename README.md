# Introduction
In this notebook, I will build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline. My completed pipeline will accept English text as input and return the French translation.

# Setup

This project requires GPU acceleration to run efficiently.


## Install
- Python 3
- NumPy
- TensorFlow 1.x
