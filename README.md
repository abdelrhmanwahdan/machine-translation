# Machine translation
In this project, I build a machine translation model Using CNNS, GRUS, transformers that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline. My completed pipeline will accept English text as input and return the French translation.

## Setup

This project requires GPU acceleration to run efficiently.

## contents
1. Data wrangling (Data gathering , Data assessing , Data cleaning).
2. Exploratory Data Analysis.
3. Making some conclusions about the data.
4. developing the models which are :
    1. Model 1: RNN
    2. Model 2: Embedding
    3. Model 3: Bidirectional RNNs
    4. Model 4: Encoder-Decoder
    5. Model 5: Custom
5. visualizing and evaluating the models.
